# Thomas High School Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to examine the effect of stripping out the potentially altered math and reading scores for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School. The Thomas High School administrators suspect academic dishonesty and want to uphold the school's academic integrity by removing the 9th grader's scores from the school's overall averages. The administrators feel doing so will provide a more accurate picture of their school's academic performance in upholding state-testing standards. 

## Results
The analysis observed a small reduction across most metrics, but not one that significantly altered the school's overall ranking. We will examine each catagory in more detail. 
## Impact on District Summary
Given Thomas High School's high performance, any reduction in its metrics will have a negative (and outsized) impact on the district’s overall metrics. By removing the Thomas High School 9th Graders, the district's average math score fell from 79 to 78.9 while its average reading score remained unchanged. We also saw a reduction in the district’s overall percentage passing math fall from 75% to 74.8% and the percentage passing reading fall from 85.8% to 85.7%. The district’s percentage of students passing both math and reading fell from 65.2% to 64.9%.

## Impact on Thomas High School Summary
### Thomas Math Scores
Average math scores fell from 83.41 to 83.35. This small reduction in the overall math average does not by itself indicate the presence of academic dishonesty, but the administrator’s decision to remove the scores in order to protect the academic integrity of their school reflects well on the culture at the school. This is also reflected in the school's rankings within the district.
### Thomas Percent Passing Math 
The percentage of students passing math fell from 93.27% to 93.18%. The lower pass rate would be expected with a reduction in the overall math scores but, much like in the previous section, the small decrease in passing percentage is not proof by itself of widespread academic dishonesty. 
### Thomas Reading Scores
Average reading scores increased from 83.84 to 83.89. The increase in reading scores with the exclusion of the 9th graders could be indicative that the reading courses 9th graders take are more challenging and result in lower scores.
### Thomas Percent Passing Reading
The percentage of students passing reading fell from 97.30% to 97.01%. This outcome is a little surprising given that reading score averages increased with the exclusion of the 9th graders. This could be explained if students begin to bifurcate into a high performing cohort and a lower performing cohort. The high performers are more numerous at the school, but the lower performing cohort does worse in 10th to 12th grade and more fail, thus bringing down the overall reading pass rate.
### Thomas Percent Passing both Math and Reading
The percentage of students passing both math and reading fell from 90.94% to 90.63%. This is reflective of what we have observed in the previous analysis.

## Impact on Thomas' Rankings within the District
Even with the reduction in average math grades and decrease in passing percentages, Thomas High School was able to retain its position as the second-best preforming school in the district.

## Impact on Math and Reading Scores by Grade
The exclusion of the Thomas High School 9th Graders lowered the district’s average math score from 80.35 to 80.12 and their average reading score from 82.50 to 82.42. This is a pretty significant change given that the excluded students make up less than 5% of the students in the district and reflects just how much higher the average Thomas High School 9th grader scores than their peers in other schools.

## Impact on Scores by School Spending
Thomas High School spends between $631 - $645 per student, so we observed a slight impact on that tranches’ overall academic performance metrics.  The average math score fell from 78.51 to 78.50 and the average reading score decreased from 73.48 to 73.46. The percentage passing  math decreased from 73.48 to 73.46 while the percentage passing reading fell from 84.39 to 84.31. The percentage passing both reading and math fell from 62.85 to 62.77. The impact of excluding the 9th graders on this group had a larger observed impact due to how much higher the Thomas High School students scored compared to other students in this group.

## Impact on Scores by School Size
The exclusion of Thomas High School’s 9th graders barely made an impact on the academic performance by school size due to the large number of schools that fall into the medium category (1000-1999 students). The average math score fell from 83.37 to 83.36 and the average reading score increased from 83.86 to 83.87. The percentage passing  math decreased from 93.59 to 93.58 while the percentage passing reading fell from 96.79 to 96.73. The percentage passing both reading and math fell from 90.62 to 90.55.

## Impact on Scores by School type
Thomas High School is a charter school, so we observed a small impact on charter schools’ overall academic performance metrics.  The average math score fell from 83.47 to 83.46 and the average reading score increased from 83.89 to 83.90. The percentage passing  math decreased from 93.62 to 93.61 while the percentage passing reading fell from 96.58 to 96.55. The percentage passing both reading and math fell from 90.43 to 90.39.

## Summary
The four changes that stand out to me from excluding the Thomas High School ninth graders from the count are: 
-	The small impact it had within the school’s averages: I think this is a good indicator of the academic consistency within Thomas High School. It’s also a positive that the academic consistency is clustered at the high end of the grading scale. 
-	The lack of impact the action had on the school’s overall ranking within the district: I think this is a continuation of the above point. I think it reflects well on the school that they were willing to take this action to address potential academic dishonesty even if it could have cost them their spot as the second highest academically performing school in the district. In this case it didn’t, but the highest performing schools are clustered very closely together at the top of the rankings. 
-	The impact it did have on the averages of the schools in the same spending categories: The largest observed impact on average grades and passing percentage was in the group of schools that spend between $631 and $645 per student. This was a little surprising as we typically equate high spending with high academic performance, but it is a good indicator that both the best and worst academically performing schools fall into the higher spending brackets. 
-	 The impact the action had on the averages of all 9th graders in the district’s math and reading averages. This is another area where I was surprised and it shows how much higher the Thomas High School 9th graders score on their reading and math exams than 9th graders in other schools in the district. This is probably to be expected as Thomas High School is the second highest performing school in the district.

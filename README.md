# Thomas High School Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to examine the effect of stripping out the potentially altered math and reading scores for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School. The Thomas High School administrators suspect academic dishonesty and want to uphold the school's academic integrity by removing the 9th grader's scores from the school's overall averages. The administrators feel doing so will provide a more accurate picture of their school's academic performance in upholding state-testing standards. 

### Results
The analysis observed a small reduction across most metrics, but not one that significantly altered the school's overall ranking. We will examine each catagory in more detail. 
### Thomas Math Scores
Average math scores fell from 83.41 to 83.35. This small reduction in the overall math average does not by itself indicate the presence of academic dishonesty, but the administrator’s decision to remove the scores in order to protect the academic integrity of their school reflects well on the culture at the school. This is also reflected in the school's rankings within the district.
### Thomas Percent Passing Math 
The percentage of students passing math fell from 93.27% to 93.18%. The lower pass rate would be expected with a reduction in the overall math scores but, much like in the previous section, the small decrease in passing percentage is not proof by itself of widespread academic dishonesty. 
### Thomas Reading Scores
Average reading scores increased from 83.84 to 83.89. The increase in reading scores with the exclusion of the 9th graders could be indicative that the reading courses 9th graders take are more challenging and result in lower scores.
### Thomas Percent Passing Reading
The percentage of students passing reading fell from 97.30% to 97.01%. This outcome is a little surprising given that reading score averages increased with the exclusion of the 9th graders. This could be explained if students begin to bifurcate into a high performing cohort and a lower performing cohort. The high performers are more numerous at the school, but the lower performing cohort does worse in 10th to 12th grade and more fail, thus bringing down the overall reading pass rate.
### Thomas Percent Passing both Math and Reading
The percentage of students passing both math and reading fell from 90.94% to 90.63%. This is reflective of what we have observed in the previous analysis.
### Impact on District
Given Thomas High School's high performance, any reduction in its metrics will have a negative (and outsized) impact on the district’s overall metrics. By removing the Thomas High School 9th Graders, the district's average math score fell from 79 to 78.9 while its average reading score remained unchanged. We also saw a reduction in the district’s overall percentage passing math fall from 75% to 74.8% and the percentage passing reading fall from 85.8% to 85.7%. The district’s percentage of students passing both math and reading fell from 65.2% to 64.9%.
### Impact on Thomas' Rankings within the District
Even with the reduction in average math grades and decrease in passing percentages, Thomas High School was able to retain its position as the second-best preforming school in the district.
